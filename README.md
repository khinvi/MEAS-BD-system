# Multi-Expert AI System for Sneaker Bot Detection (MEAS-BD)

*A research-oriented approach to building a novel mixture-of-experts machine learning architecture to detect and classify automated bot traffic targeting limited-edition sneaker releases.* üëü

## Overview

The **Multi-Expert AI System for Sneaker Bot Detection (MEAS-BD)** project is really about tackling a growing problem: **sneaker bots**. These automated programs are designed to snag super-limited-edition sneakers online which leave many genuine enthusiasts empty-handed, hurting brand reputation in the process. We're exploring whether a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture can help us detect and classify this bot traffic.

Essentially, we're trying to:

- Develop a new kind of MoE machine learning architecture specifically designed to spot sneaker bots.
- Figure out the best *expert models* to identify different kinds of bot behavior.
- Experiment with different *gating mechanisms* to dynamically route online traffic to the most relevant expert.
- Create a solid research framework for understanding and mitigating the impact of sneaker bots.

This repository is where we'll be sharing all our code, documentation, and research findings as the project progresses. We'll keep it updated as we go! üöÄ

## Partnerships

We're actively seeking partnerships with companies like **Nike, Adidas, StockX**, and **GOAT** to make this research even more impactful. By collaborating and gaining access to their data, we believe we can develop more effective solutions to combat sneaker bot challenges and ensure that everyone has a fair shot at those limited-edition releases.

## Key Features (Anticipated)

Here are some of the key features we anticipate this project will have:

- **Modular Architecture:** The MoE design gives us the flexibility to incorporate different types of expert models, each specializing in detecting specific bot characteristics.
- **Adaptive Detection:** We expect the gating mechanism to enable the system to adapt dynamically to evolving bot tactics.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle high volumes of traffic for real-world deployment.
- **Explainability:** Techniques to help visualize how the MoE model makes its decisions, providing insights into bot behavior. üí°

## LLM Utilization

In this research project, we are leveraging the capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to aid in various aspects of code generation. LLMs are helping us to:

- Generate initial code structures for different components of the system.
- Accelerate the development of helper functions and utility scripts.
- Explore different implementation approaches and prototype ideas more rapidly.

We believe that LLMs can be valuable tools in research, enabling us to explore complex problems more efficiently. However, all generated code is **thoroughly reviewed, tested, and refined** by our research team to ensure accuracy, reliability, and alignment with the project's goals.

## Technical Approach (Planned)

The MEAS-BD system will explore a combination of machine learning techniques, including:

- **Supervised Learning:** Training expert models on labeled data of bot and human traffic.
- **Deep Learning:** Utilizing neural networks for complex pattern recognition in high-dimensional data.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining predictions of multiple experts to improve overall accuracy.

We'll analyze various features, such as:

- **Network Traffic:** IP addresses, request rates, headers, and other network-level information.
- **User Behavior:** Mouse movements, keystroke dynamics, browsing patterns, and other behavioral data.
- **Browser Fingerprinting:** Unique characteristics of the user's browser and device.

## Evaluation Metrics (Planned)

We plan to evaluate the performance of the MEAS-BD system using a range of metrics, including:

- **Accuracy:** Overall proportion of correctly classified traffic.
- **Precision:** Proportion of correctly identified bot traffic out of all classified as bots.
- **Recall:** Proportion of correctly identified bot traffic out of all actual bot traffic.
- **F1-score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **False Positive Rate:** Proportion of legitimate human traffic incorrectly classified as bots.

## Challenges

This research project anticipates several challenges, including:

- **Evolving Bot Tactics:** Sneaker bot developers constantly adapt their techniques to evade detection.
- **Data Scarcity:** Difficulties in acquiring labeled data of diverse bot behaviors.
- **Real-time Performance:** Need for minimal latency in bot detection.
- **Generalizability:** System must work across different platforms and bot types.

## Future Work

The next steps in this research include:

- Developing more sophisticated expert models to detect novel bot behaviors.
- Exploring advanced gating mechanisms to improve traffic routing.
- Investigating active learning to reduce the need for large labeled datasets.
- Deploying and evaluating the system in real-world settings.
