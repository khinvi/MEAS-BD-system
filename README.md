# Multi-Expert AI System for Sneaker Bot Detection (MEAS-BD)

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-research_in_progress-yellow.svg)

*A research-oriented approach to building a novel mixture-of-experts machine learning architecture to detect and classify automated bot traffic targeting limited-edition sneaker releases.* 👟

## Overview

The **Multi-Expert AI System for Sneaker Bot Detection (MEAS-BD)** project is really about tackling a growing problem: **sneaker bots**. These automated programs are designed to snag super-limited-edition sneakers online on platforms such as Nike SNKRS, which leave actual "sneaker-heads" empty-handed, hurting brand reputation in the process. We're exploring whether a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture can help us detect and classify this bot traffic.

Essentially, we're trying to:

- Develop a new kind of MoE machine learning architecture specifically designed to spot sneaker bots.
- Figure out the best *expert models* to identify different kinds of bot behavior.
- Experiment with different *gating mechanisms* to dynamically route online traffic to the most relevant expert.
- Create a solid research framework for understanding and mitigating the impact of sneaker bots.

This repository is where we'll be sharing all our code, documentation, and research findings as the project progresses. We'll keep it updated as we go! 🚀

MEAS-BD employs a specialized mixture-of-experts approach to identify sneaker bot traffic using multiple behavioral and technical dimensions:

- **Temporal Pattern Expert (TPE)**: Analyzes timing patterns in user sessions
- **Navigation Sequence Expert (NSE)**: Evaluates browsing patterns and page transitions
- **Input Behavior Expert (IBE)**: Examines mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke dynamics
- **Technical Fingerprint Expert (TFE)**: Analyzes device and browser characteristics
- **Purchase Pattern Expert (PPE)**: Identifies suspicious checkout and purchasing behaviors

A meta-learning layer dynamically weights expert opinions based on context and confidence, allowing the system to adapt to new bot strategies without complete retraining. For now, these are the five experts we are tinkering with, however, we are open to employing others in the future _(the more the merrier...)_

## Partnerships

We're actively seeking partnerships with companies like **Nike, Adidas, StockX**, and **GOAT** to make this research even more impactful. By collaborating and gaining access to their data, we believe we can develop more effective solutions to combat sneaker bot challenges and ensure that everyone has a fair shot at those limited-edition releases.

## Key Features

- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Examines user behavior across multiple domains to identify bot patterns
- **Adaptive Meta-learning**: Dynamically adjusts expert weights based on their performance and confidence
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Includes tools to create realistic synthetic data for training and testing
- **Active Learning Support**: Identifies the most informative samples for labeling to maximize learning

## LLM Utilization

In this research project, we are leveraging the capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to aid in various aspects of code generation. LLMs are helping us to:

- Generate initial code structures for different components of the system.
- Accelerate the development of helper functions and utility scripts.
- Explore different implementation approaches and prototype ideas more rapidly.

We believe that LLMs can be valuable tools in research, enabling us to explore complex problems more efficiently. However, all generated code is **thoroughly reviewed, tested, and refined** by our research team to ensure accuracy, reliability, and alignment with the project's goals.

python -m src.main --config path/to/config.json --mode train --save-model models/my_model
```

### Evaluating Performance

To evaluate the performance of a trained model:

```bash
python -m src.main --config path/to/config.json --mode evaluate --load-model models/my_model
```

This will generate comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations.

### Cross-Validation

Run cross-validation to ensure model stability:

```bash
python -m src.main --config path/to/config.json --mode cross-validate
```

## Architecture

### Expert Models

Each expert model specializes in a specific aspect of user behavior:

1. **Temporal Pattern Expert**
   - LSTM-based model for analyzing timing patterns
   - Detects unnatural consistency, suspicious speed, and other timing anomalies

2. **Navigation Sequence Expert**
   - Transformer-based model for evaluating browsing patterns
   - Identifies suspicious navigation sequences and page transition patterns

3. **Input Behavior Expert**
   - CNN-based model for analyzing mouse and keyboard dynamics
   - Detects automated inputs and non-human interaction patterns

4. **Technical Fingerprint Expert**
   - Random Forest model for browser and device fingerprinting
   - Identifies inconsistencies in technical characteristics

5. **Purchase Pattern Expert**
   - Gradient Boosting model for checkout and purchase behavior
   - Detects suspicious payment and shipping patterns

### Meta-Learning Framework

The meta-learning layer:
- Combines expert predictions with dynamic weighting
- Adjusts weights based on recent performance and confidence
- Adapts to evolving bot strategies over time

### Data Components

- **Synthetic Data Generator**: Creates realistic human and bot sessions
- **Data Preprocessor**: Handles feature normalization and selection
- **Data Storage**: Manages persistence of sessions and results
